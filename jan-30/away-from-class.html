    I traveled to Iceland in 2012 and spent a month driving around the country. I went just as summer was peaking. The sun never completely set. When I reached Husavik, I decided to go out on the Norweigian Sea. I saw a blue whale. The blue whale rolled around on the side of our boat, went underneath our boat, and basically tagged along with us for a while. I'm not sure I will ever experience anything like this again. Everything was beautiful.

    Please enjoy these photos I took during my time in Iceland! Unfortunately, I was guarded about sharing my blue whale pictures on Flickr, but I <i>also</i> love sheep and the ocean, so I figured I would give my 488 training a whirl and try to review some HTML basics. Apologies for any dated HTML tags. I should also preface that I only learned in-line CSS, but am excited to learn all best practices!

    Apologies for over-sharing! I never seem to balance contextualizing code-learning with creating an interesting narrative.
